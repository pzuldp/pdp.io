Hi! Welcome to my professionnal webpage :) 

I work as a senior economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](https://www.ipp.eu) in Paris. That means I spend most of my working time mobilizing applied econometrics techniques in order to evaluate public policies.

Topics on which I'm currently working:
- the carbon footprint of French firms and policies to reduce it 
- broadband Internet infrastructure policies
- labor market transformations (digitalization, gender inequalities) 
- labor market policies (shortterm work, gender equality indices)
- household and firm taxation

Topics on which I've worked in the past:
- pension system in South Africa
- internal migrations in China
- local bureaucrats of the Chinese Communist Party

You'll find an overview of my research [here](publications/), and my CV [here](cv/).

I also contribute
- to the [openfisca community](https://openfisca.org), 
- to the development of [TAXIPP](https://www.ipp.eu/en/methods/taxipp-micro-simulation/), a microsimulation software for the French tax and benefit system, and 
- to the maintenance of the [Bar√®mes IPP](https://www.ipp.eu/baremes-ipp), a database of legislative parameters

Don't hesitate to contact me :)
