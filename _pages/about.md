Hi! Welcome to this website. I'm Paul Dutronc-Postel. I work as a senior economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](www.ipp.eu) in Paris. That means I spend most of my working time mobilizing applied econometrics techniques in order to evaluate public policies.

Topics that I'm currently working on:
- the carbon footprint of French firms and policies to reduce it 
- broadband Internet infrastructure policies
- labor market transformations (digitalization, gender inequalities) 
- labor market policies (shortterm work, gender equality indices)
- household and firm taxation

Topics on which I've worked on in the past:
- pension system in South Africa
- internal migrations in China
- local bureaucrats of the Chinese Communist Party

You'll find an overview of my research [here](), and my CV [here]().

I also contribute to the [openfisca community](https://openfisca.org), to the development of [TAXIPP](https://www.ipp.eu/en/methods/taxipp-micro-simulation/), a microsimulation software for the French tax and benefit system, and to the maintenance of the [Bar√®mes IPP](www.ipp.eu/baremes-ipp), a database of legislative parameters.

Don't hesitate to contact me to chat about the topics mentioned above :)
