Hi! Welcome to my professionnal webpage :) 

I work as a senior economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](https://www.ipp.eu) in Paris, where I head the "Environment" team. This means that:
- I spend most of my working time mobilizing applied econometrics techniques in order to evaluate public policies empirically,
- and that in a lot of these projects, environmental aspects are a key feature of interest.

I'm currently working on topics related to housing retrofit subsidies; decarbonization subsidies; and carpooling practices.

You'll find an overview of my research [here](research/), and my CV [here](cv/).

Even though I am now less active in them, I also have contributed to the following communities, which I recommend you check out if you've ever harboured an interest in taxes (and transfers!):
- to the [openfisca community](https://openfisca.org), a open-source framework to model tax-and-benefit systems,
- to the development of [TAXIPP](https://www.ipp.eu/en/methods/taxipp-micro-simulation/), a microsimulation software for the French tax and benefit system, and 
- to the maintenance of the [Bar√®mes IPP](https://www.ipp.eu/baremes-ipp), a database of legislative parameters
