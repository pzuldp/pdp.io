Hi! Welcome to my professionnal webpage :) 

I work as a senior economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](https://www.ipp.eu) in Paris, where I head the "Environment" team. This means that:
- I spend most of my working time mobilizing applied econometrics techniques in order to evaluate public policies empirically,
- and that in a lot of these projects, environmental aspects are a key feature of interest (technically, "environment" here mostly means climate change and carbon emissions).

I'm **currently working** on topics related to **housing retrofit subsidies**; **decarbonization subsidies**; **carpooling practices**; and the **adaptation of social protection to climate change**.

You'll find an overview of my research [here](research/), and my CV [here](cv/).

Also:
- I am an active contributor to the [Openfisca community](https://openfisca.org), a open-source framework to model tax-and-benefit systems, which I recommend you check out if you've ever harboured an interest in taxes (and transfers!)
- Together with S. Duchesne and L. Josseran at IPP, I maintain the [Bar√®mes IPP](https://www.ipp.eu/baremes-ipp), a database of legislative parameters
- I used to actively develop [TAXIPP](https://www.ipp.eu/en/methods/taxipp-micro-simulation/), a microsimulation software for the French tax and benefit system. I am not really active in this domain anymore, but I am still keen on discussing microsimulation techniques.
