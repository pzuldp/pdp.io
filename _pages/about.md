Hi! Welcome to my professionnal webpage :) 

I work as a senior economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](https://www.ipp.eu) in Paris, where I head the "Environment" team. That means I spend most of my working time mobilizing applied econometrics techniques in order to evaluate public policies; and that in a lot of these projects, environmental aspects are a key feature of interest.

I'm currently working on 
- the carbon footprint of French firms and decarbonization policies
- on labor market transformations and policies
- household and firm taxation
- housing energy efficiency
- car-sharing

In the past, I've worked on the South African pension system, internal migrations in China and on the career of local bureaucrats of the Chinese Communist Party.

You'll find an overview of my research [here](research/), and my CV [here](cv/).

I also contribute
- to the [openfisca community](https://openfisca.org), 
- to the development of [TAXIPP](https://www.ipp.eu/en/methods/taxipp-micro-simulation/), a microsimulation software for the French tax and benefit system, and 
- to the maintenance of the [Bar√®mes IPP](https://www.ipp.eu/baremes-ipp), a database of legislative parameters
