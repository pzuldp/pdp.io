Hi! Welcome to my professionnal webpage :) 

I work as a senior economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](https://www.ipp.eu) in Paris. That means I spend most of my working time mobilizing applied econometrics techniques in order to evaluate public policies.

I'm currently working on the carbon footprint of French firms, on labor market transformations and policies, and on household and firm taxation.

In the past, I've worked on the South African pension system, internal migrations in China and on the career of local bureaucrats of the Chinese Communist Party.

You'll find an overview of my research [here](publications/), and my CV [here](cv/).

I also contribute
- to the [openfisca community](https://openfisca.org), 
- to the development of [TAXIPP](https://www.ipp.eu/en/methods/taxipp-micro-simulation/), a microsimulation software for the French tax and benefit system, and 
- to the maintenance of the [Bar√®mes IPP](https://www.ipp.eu/baremes-ipp), a database of legislative parameters

Don't hesitate to contact me at paul.dutronc[at]ipp.eu
