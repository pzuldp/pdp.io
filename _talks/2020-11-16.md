Every year, the Institut des politiques publiques holds a joing conference with the CEPREMAP in the Fall, when the French parliament is debating the Budget law for the next year (the law has to be voted before December 31st). The IPP and CEPREMAP invite members of the Finance Commission of the Assembl√©e Nationale (House of Representatives) to debate their results.
